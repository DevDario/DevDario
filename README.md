## Code is poetry 👨🏻‍💻

<p>
I create ideias and develop solutions in the shape of webpages and software using my creativity and my technical knowledge in HTML, JavaScript, SASS, Java, NodeJs and PHP by building web apps with React and natives web technologies that aren't just beautiful, but are enjoyable to use, acessible to everyone and really problem-solvers.
  Also I learning to create scalable softwares and readable code that can make it ease for you to learn and/or create new projects using codes from my projects 😉
